Price Optimization Project (Retail Dataset)

This project analyzes retail product pricing data to:
- Clean and prepare the dataset.
- Visualize key trends using graphs and stats.
- Build a regression model to predict discounted price.
- Implement a smart pricing strategy based on customer ratings.

 Features
- Dynamic discount recommendation logic.
- Actual vs Predicted pricing analysis.
- Suggested optimal price per product.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Machine Learning using Linear Regression.

Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

Business Insights
- Poorly rated products can be incentivized using higher discounts.
- High-rated products may not need as much discounting.
- The optimal price logic can inform inventory and pricing strategies.

Future Work
- Add classification to predict high/low sales likelihood.
- Predict best discount % using ML (Random Forest or XGBoost).
- Build an interactive Streamlit or Flask dashboard.
